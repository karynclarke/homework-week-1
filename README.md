Homework Week 1
What I did, to make this more client and user-friendly:
  * Head- changed the title, now shows up in navigation bar.
  * Body- made the name of the company much more prominent. Added the three elements on the right to the titling. All can be navigated to now, although I had to add a div class to do it.  
  * Added alt tags to all six elements.  Centered the text on the right with some help from the W3 website, and some luck. 
  * Made the three elements on the left, the hero elements, larger text with less empty blue space. 
  * Adjusted the elements on the right to make text bigger, logos smaller.  The bottom of the box they were contained in now lines up with the left side elements. 

  * Used the W3 website for the centering and blocking, did a lot of trial and error as far as layout.  Listened in office hours about combining elements in CSS, leaving evidence of the old code behind just to show the trail. 

  * Tried to combine more elements and eliminate some of the div classes, but couldn't get the navigation to work otherwise.  Wanted the navigation bar to show the elements I added to the header bar but ran out of time knowing this would be the first attempt to publish to Git.
